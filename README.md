# Particle System Animation (Java Swing)

![Particle System Animation](./animation.gif)

## Overview
This is a **Java Swing-based particle system animation** that simulates particle movement, collision handling, and dynamic connections between particles. It creates a visually appealing effect using simple physics-based interactions.

## Features
- Particle movement with velocity, friction, and gravity.
- Collision detection and response.
- Line connections between nearby particles with fading opacity.
- Smooth animation using `JPanel` and `Graphics`.
- **Note**: The effects of friction and gravity do not appear unless their values are set to something other than `0`. To observe their effect, adjust the `gravity` and `friction` values in the `Drawer` class.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GodXero33/ParticleSystemAnimation-JavaSwing.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
3. Compile and run the project.

## Usage
- The animation starts automatically when you run the program.
- Click on the panel to add new particles dynamically.
